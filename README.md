This code is for a multi user Chatbot game. It uses Switch cases, key words and prompts to get a response from the user. 

How to run the Code and play the Game:
The game prompts the user with a question and two response options. Depending on the response entered by the user, the code returns with another question. The game ends once the user reaches the final question.
